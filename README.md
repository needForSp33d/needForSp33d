- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris

- My handle is based on my interest in and love of all things quality & performance.
  
- This account is all about sharing and show-casing my learnings.

- I'm interested in:
  - Test frameworks throughout the test pyramid.
  - Performance testing.
  - Accessibility testing.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bash, javascript, and python languages. But also sick performance focused tooling.
